## Copyright information

Much of the technical documenation and information comes from Zebra Technologies Corporation's public documentation and an amount of trial-and-error from working with an array of LP2844 printers with assembly dates between 2000 and 2008.

Zebra have graciously made this information public through reference documentation available on their website. When in doubt please seek their information! The company makes robust printers that continue to be well supported. The latest available printers they manufacture are compatible with EPL command sets dating back to the 90s. I can't recommend them highly enough for any integrator concerned with making sure their systems continue to work into the future.
